# TODO

- figure out how to handle Gaze file change events that come in during the initial wave of processing
	- maybe save them to a queue and process them once we're done with the initial wave?
- maybe some sort of way to have parameterized generated files. Not sure how this would look exactly. There could be some files that we want to process in one of two (or more) ways, depending on where they're used from, but we can't tell from the file itself how it should be processed. We could push responsibility for this processing into the transform etc. that needs the processed file, but that doesn't seem ideal, as when one dependency changes that would involve re-processing other unchanged things we've already processed. One case I've run into that would benefit from such a feature is compilation of Svelte components: Looking at the component itself, there's nothing to indicate whether it should be compiled in `ssr` or `dom` mode. Ideally, whichever transform requires a particular version of it could request that (and it would be generated then, or retrieved from a pre-existing cache). It might be best if this were a whole separate third type of thing, apart from physical and generated files
