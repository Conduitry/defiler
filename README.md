# Defiler: A small, strange building block.

[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/defiler.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/defiler)

Defiler is a small build tool framework with strange opinions. It was born out of a desire to redo the build process for my various personal websites. I wanted something that was very flexible, kept everything in memory as it was building, and could handle arbitrary dependencies between files so that when something changed, only the necessary files would be re-built.

Defiler is a build tool for people who find build tools interesting.
